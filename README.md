Random Password Generator

## Overview
This project is a simple web-based application that generates random, secure passwords. Users can generate a password with a single click and easily copy it to their clipboard for use in other applications.

Features
- Generates a random password with a fixed length of 12 characters.
- Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
- Allows users to copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for generating and copying passwords.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-password-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd random-password-generator
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser:
   - Double-click the `index.html` file.
   - Or use a local server (e.g., [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code).

### Usage
1. **Click the "Generate Password" button** to create a random password.
2. **Copy the password** by clicking the copy icon next to the password field.
3. Paste the copied password wherever needed.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for the application's styling.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the password generation and copy functionality (currently embedded in `index.html`).
- `images/`: A directory containing images used in the project, such as the copy and generate icons.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading.

## Code Explanation

### JavaScript Functionality
- **Password Generation (`createPassword`)**: 
  - The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from predefined character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).
  - The password always includes at least one character from each set, ensuring a mix of character types.
  - The password length is fixed at 12 characters.
  
- **Copy to Clipboard (`copyPassword`)**:
  - This function selects the text in the password input field and copies it to the clipboard for easy use.

### CSS
- The CSS file (`style.css`) should handle the styling of the application, including the layout and appearance of the buttons, input fields, and other elements.

## Troubleshooting
- **Password not generating?** Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser and that there are no errors in the console.
- **Copy function not working?** Check that the browser supports the `document.execCommand("copy")` method, as some newer browser versions may require alternative methods for copying to the clipboard.
